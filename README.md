# Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install it
You must install node.js, docker and docker-compose.

```
Give examples
I strongly recommend downloading the LTS versions from: https://nodejs.org/en/ and https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

First, you'll clone the repository from github. 
Then, open the folder you just cloned - make sure you docker service is running. 
Run docker-compose build to create the container, and, to finish, run docker-compose up to start the container.
With these steps, the environment should be running smoothly at localhost:3333.

```
git clone https://github.com/LeoFC97/deliveryMuch
cd deliveryMuch
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
